Following the instructions at https://typeorm.io/

    'synchronize' will not create a new database - however, it will create new table(s) in a database.
    TRY LATER: You can generate an even more advanced project with express installed by running npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database mysql --express command.

    postgres - use single quotes as opposed to double quotes to indicate values in a column

    ex. WHERE username = 'forHimAndHis' vs. WHERE username = "forHimAndHis"
